## Patch
  3/17/2020 - I added a feature that users can turn on in the settings panel called "Curse of the Mask".
  Enabling "Curse of the Mask" will cause the parade float to throw a spooky mask 1/3 of the time
  The spooky mask works the same as any other projectile except that if a player picks it up
  they will lose 200 points
